		<h2 id="successful">JOHO'S BEAN</h2>
		<p>
		<a href="http://johos.at/#/en/0/0"> Joho's Bean</a>	
		Website is a visual storytelling documentary showcasing the journey of Joho's coffee beans. The site provides a generous amount of information for the audience, both text images/videos that require users to spend more time to slowly navigate the site in order to follow the story. The site provides symbols in the corners that guide users across the web and ease of use increases as they navigate.

		<p> The site exemplifies the idea of when beauty meets function. Not only is the site informative but also visually pleasing to the eyes with exquisite choices of design aesthetics and reliable interactivity. Despite having a lot of information to cover, the design is thoroughly laid out and executed where design elements does not get in the way of the content. This site’s main feature is to show audiences the backside story of their product, taking them on a vicarious experience with visual imagery, videos, and bringing the experience closer by including sounds from nature that further engage people’s attention. Ultimately, the sound effectively ties all the elements together creating a compelling, emotional and realistic experience for users watching the journey of a coffee bean.

	<h2 id="less-successful">METROPOLIS COFFEE</h2>
	
<p><a href="http://metropoliscoffee.com">Metropolis Coffee</a> have categories arranged on the site and can be easily accessed. The site also provides an abundant amount of information. Users may be able to accomplish basic tasks like navigating through the site and processing information and would be able to reestablish proficiency. However, the design is handled less effectively where the layout is compact and clustered with information. The interface is not as effective because there are many focal points and holds many distractions making the design less sufficient and not so pleasing to use. The goals of the website may not correspond with users’ especially when the homepage is overfilled with elements and provides no sense of direction. The site has its necessary utilities but could improve on usability where many design choices could be made differently to enhance a more spread out environment and better arranged information like text, imagery and video that do not compress together.  </p>

		Furthermore, the hierarchy is poorly arranged with font sizes and typography that fail to unify the elements and content altogether. Using more than two typefaces will break the consistency and certain areas include words that are slightly more difficult to read than others due to smaller choice in font selection or using a similar color to the background it lies in (i.e., dark grey against a black background). Moreover, a clearer layout and improved organization of elements would offer instant gratification and understanding of provided content. Clumped spaces with information may fluster user’s experience if they have to spend more time they need to process knowledge.
